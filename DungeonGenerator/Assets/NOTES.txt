When creating a room, make sure that it tries to create enough so that it doesn't skip creating.
Min/Max size of a room, and check when creating door, if there is at least the minimum amount of space left; if not - change direction.
Multiple doors in a room.  (func: only open one? (choices))


SET CORNERS OF THE ROOMS!!

TODO:

* remove sprites of walls. (Skipped)
* Board should be represented as GamePieces, not ENUMS (Is both)
* Need to add interactable gameobjects such as enemies and events ( Trigger something ) (In progress)
* Limit the amount of pieces that can be generated
* Goal / Object that you can get to to "finish" the game.

LATER TODO:
* Choices that change how the dungeon is generated (LOOK/FEEL?)
