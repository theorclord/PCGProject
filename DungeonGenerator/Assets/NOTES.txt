Doors: Direction from the room they are made, so a door in the top of a room(when created) gets the direction NORTH



TODO:

* make it so the doors are where you enter ( entrance vector )
* remove sprites of walls. (Skipped)
* Connect walls that share door (ROOMS)
* Board should be represented as GamePieces, not ENUMS
* Need to add interactable gameobjects such as enemies and events ( Trigger something )
* Limit the amount of pieces that can be generated
* Goal / Object that you can get to to "finish" the game.

LATER TODO:
* Choices that change how the dungeon is generated (LOOK/FEEL?)
